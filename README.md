# graphic-design-portfolio
IÂ´m a Portugal-based freelance graphic designer and illustrator specialising in logo design, brand identity and illustration.
I created this repository to store all my contributions in OpenSource projects as a graphic designer, my goal is to create an application where we can all share our designs.
